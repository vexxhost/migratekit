# migratekit

Migratekit is a CLI tool which can help you to migrate your virtual machines
from VMware to OpenStack in a near-zero downtime.  The goal of this project
is to allow you to move as much data as possible online and only have a short
downtime window to complete the migration.

## How it works

Migratekit has two phases that it operates in to allow you to migrate your
virtual machine with almost no downtime which are documented below.

These phases allow you to move data online as much as possible and have a 
final cutover phase which takes the virtual machine offline for a short
period of time to complete the migration.

### Migration phase

You will generally run as many migration cycles as you need, they will run
without any downtime to the virtual machine.

On your first migration cycle, Migratekit will do a full copy of the virtual
machine to the OpenStack cloud.  On subsequent migration cycles, Migratekit
will only copy the changes that have been made to the virtual machine since the
last migration cycle.

### Cutover phase

Once you are ready to cut over to the OpenStack cloud, you will run the cutover
phase.  This will ensure all of the matching resources such as Neutron ports
exist on the cloud, do a final sync of the virtual machine, power it off inside
of VMware, execute a final sync, and then build a new virtual machine on the
OpenStack cloud using the same volumes as the original virtual machine.

## Usage

The easiest supported way of running Migratekit is by using the Docker image
which is shipped with all of the dependencies required to run Migratekit except
for the [VMware Disk Development Kit (VDDK)](https://developer.broadcom.com/sdks/vmware-virtual-disk-development-kit-vddk/8.0) which you will need to download
from the VMware website.

### Installing VDDK

In order to be able to use Migratekit, you will need to download the VDDK from
the VMware website.  You will ened to create a developer account in order to
download the VDDK as well as accept the EULA.

1. Download [VMware Virtual Disk Development Kit (VDDK) 8.0.2 for Linux](https://developer.broadcom.com/sdks/vmware-virtual-disk-development-kit-vddk/8.0)
2. Once you've downloaded the file, you will need to extract the contents of the
   tarball to a directory on your system.
3. We recommend that you extract the contents of the tarball to `/usr/lib64/vmware-vix-disklib/`
   on your system.  If you decide to extract the contents to a different directory,
   you will need to update the Docker volume mount in the next section to reflect
   the directory you extracted the tarball to.

### Configuring account for Migratekit

If you are using vCenter, you will need an account with at least the following permissions
to be able to use Migratekit:

| Privilege Name in the vSphere Client             | Purpose                                                            | Required On                   | Privilege Name in the API                          |

| Change Configuration - Acquire disk lease        | Allow disk lease operations to read VM disks using the VMware vSphere Virtual Disk Development Kit (VDDK). | Virtual machines               | VirtualMachine.Config.DiskLease                    |
| Provisioning - Allow read-only disk access       | Enable read-only access to VM disks for data reading using the VDDK. | Virtual machines               | VirtualMachine.Provisioning.DiskRandomRead         |

### Running Migratekit

Assuming that you already have Docker installed on your system, you can use the
following command to run the Migratekit Docker container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --privileged \
  -v /dev:/dev \
  -v /usr/lib64/vmware-vix-disklib/:/usr/lib64/vmware-vix-disklib:ro \
  --env-file <(env | grep OS_) \
  registry.atmosphere.dev/library/migratekit:latest \
  --help
```

If you want to get started with running your first migration cycle, you can run
it with the following command:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --privileged \
  -v /dev:/dev \
  -v /usr/lib64/vmware-vix-disklib/:/usr/lib64/vmware-vix-disklib:ro \
  --env-file <(env | grep OS_) \
  registry.atmosphere.dev/library/migratekit:latest \
  migrate \
  --vmware-endpoint vmware.local \
  --vmware-username username \
  --vmware-password password \
  --vmware-path /ha-datacenter/vm/migration-test
```

In the example above, you would run the migration cycle against a virtual machine
located at `/ha-datacenter/vm/migration-test` on the VMware endpoint `vmware.local`
(which can be both an ESXi host or a vCenter server).  The endpoint can also be
an IP address if you do not have a DNS entry for the endpoint.

You will also need to make sure you have all of your OpenStack environment variables
set in your environment before running the command so that Migratekit can connect
to the OpenStack cloud.

Once you've ran this command a few times and you're happy that you're ready to
cutover, you can run the following command to cutover to the OpenStack cloud:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --privileged \
  -v /dev:/dev \
  -v /usr/lib64/vmware-vix-disklib/:/usr/lib64/vmware-vix-disklib:ro \
  --env-file <(env | grep OS_) \
  registry.atmosphere.dev/library/migratekit:latest \
  cutover \
  --vmware-endpoint vmware.local \
  --vmware-username username \
  --vmware-password password \
  --vmware-path /ha-datacenter/vm/migration-test \
  --flavor b542cedb-d3b4-4446-a43f-5416711440ee \
  --network-mapping mac=00:0c:29:7d:2d:68,network-id=2a81f1b0-c1b8-48dd-bd8e-4d976608c06d,subnet-id=21a7110b-2ab2-4cc1-8372-8b552f7a4438,ip=192.168.2.20
```

You should run it with the same arguments, however, this time you will need to
specify the flavor that you want to use for the virtual machine on the OpenStack
cloud as well as the network mapping that you want to use for the virtual machine.

The network mapping allows Migratekit to know what network to attach the virtual
machine to on the OpenStack cloud, as well as the IP address that you want to
assign to the virtual machine since it cannot map this information from VMware.

The format of the network mapping is as follows:

- `mac`: The MAC address of the virtual interface on the virtual machine that you
         want to map to the OpenStack network (required).
- `network-id`: The UUID of the network that you want to attach the virtual machine
               to on the OpenStack cloud (required).
- `subnet-id`: The UUID of the subnet that you want to attach the virtual machine
               to on the OpenStack cloud (required).
- `ip`: The IP address that you want to assign to the virtual machine on the OpenStack
        cloud (optional, Neutron will assign an IP address if this is not specified).

You should ideally match the network mapping to the network that the virtual machine
is attached to on the VMware side to ensure that the virtual machine can communicate
with the network once it has been migrated to the OpenStack cloud.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to this project, we hope to see this project grow and
become a useful tool for people to migrate their virtual machines from VMware
to OpenStack.

Since VMware environments can be quite complex, we are happy to work with
contributors to add support for more complex VMware environments to Migratekit
for the benefit of the community, but we need your help to do so because of
a lack of access to these environments and their licensing costs.

## Support

If you need help with using Migratekit, you can either open an issue to get
help from the community or you can contact [VEXXHOST](https://vexxhost.com/contact-us/)
for professional support with VMware migration or OpenStack.
